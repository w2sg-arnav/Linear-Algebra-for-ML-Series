    "1. For Exercise 1, we created a 1D numpy array (vector) with 5 elements representing grades in different subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For Exercise 2, we created a 2D numpy array (matrix) where:\n",
    "   - Each row represents a different student\n",
    "   - Each column represents a different subject\n",
    "   - The shape (3, 5) indicates 3 students and 5 subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For Exercise 3, we used `np.mean()` with `axis=1` to calculate the mean along each row:\n",
    "   - `axis=1` tells numpy to average across columns (subjects) for each row (student)\n",
    "   - The result is a 1D array with one average grade per student\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how we can use vectors and matrices to organize and analyze data efficiently!"

```

## Getting Started

1. Start with `README.md` for an overview
2. Work through `lecture_01_notebook.ipynb`
3. Try exercises at the end of each section
4. Use interactive visualizations to build intuition
5. Practice with additional problems
6. Check solutions when stuck

## Key Concepts Covered

1. First Principles
   - What makes algebra "linear"
   - Basic objects and operations
   - Geometric interpretations

2. Fundamental Operations
   - Vector addition and scaling
   - Dot product
   - Vector projections

3. Applications in ML
   - Feature vectors
   - Similarity measures
   - Linear transformations

## Tips for Success

1. **Build Intuition**
   - Use interactive visualizations
   - Draw diagrams
   - Connect to real examples

2. **Practice Regularly**
   - Solve all exercises
